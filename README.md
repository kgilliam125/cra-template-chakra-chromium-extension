This is a creact-react-app template for developing Chromium based browser extensions using
Typescript, React, ChakraUI, and Craco to avoid the need to eject when building your project. 
It is based off of the standard create-react-app template.

Using npm
```
npx create-react-app my-app --template chakra-chromium-extension
```

Using yarn
```
yarn create react-app my-app --template chakra-chromium-extension
```
